# Unit ４ Project: home brewry lecip 

 ## Criteria A: Planning

## Problem definition(Client identification)

The problem I am currently facing is that my business is centered around home brewing kits, but home brewing culture is not well-established in Japan. I have noticed that there is no social media platform available for sharing beer recipes, and while some blogs do provide recipes and original brewing methods, it is difficult for home brewers to exchange information and methods with each other. Beer has unique characteristics and regional differences based on the type of hops and malt used, the type of adjuncts used, and the type of sugar used as a boost during secondary fermentation. Unfortunately, there are currently limited platforms that are secure, organized, and safe for sharing such information and methods among home brewers. Accessing such information is currently only possible by visiting breweries or attending beer making experience sessions, making it difficult to determine the quality of the recipes found online. As proof of this issue, I have attached email correspondence I had with my client in a folder.(See evidence of consultation in Appendix 1)

## Proposed Solution
To solve the client's problem I will be creating a website using HTML CSS and Python. The site will have a login and sign up system to allow for multiple users. It is a platform for users to share beer recipes and unique brewing methods. The site will also allow users to share information such as ingredients and other information.

## Raatinale for propsed solution

This project will provide a solution to a problem where home brewing culture is not yet common in Niobraska. Web-based social media sites make it easy to share information and methods, and it is expected to create a rounded community of people interested in homebrewing.
As mentioned in the problem statement, it is currently difficult to obtain information on home brewing in Japan. This web-based social media will provide a place where people can easily share information and ideas about information and methods.
From a data management perspective, this project will design a beta base to store and manage user-uploaded recipes, their images, and data, with a back-end system implemented in Python to handle operations such as adding, editing, and deleting data.
HTML and CSS were chosen to build the basic structure and style of the website, while Python was chosen for the back-end development. These technologies are in the context of the project and are widely used as well as the experience of the developers.
As an alternative, other programming languages such as PHP or JavaScript could be used, but Python is known for its simplicity and extensibility, and is well suited for data processing and database manipulation. In addition, Python frameworks such as Django and Flask provide additional functionality to facilitate web development.
Prior to the implementation of the project, I conducted research on the proposed solution and the tools to be used: HTML and CSS are fundamental to web design, and Python is a common choice for back-end development. In addition, Python frameworks (Django and Flask) provide additional features that facilitate web application development and are used in many successful projects. For the database, SQLite would be a good choice, as SQLAlchemy's interface offers better performance and is protected against security attacks
In addition, we researched similar social media platforms and beer enthusiast websites for good user experience practices and features. This gave us confidence that our proposed solution would be feasible and effective.

Finally, we would also focus on proper data management and privacy protection to ensure the success of the project. This includes database design, security measures, and user rights management. In this way, our web-based social media sites are expected to become a trusted source of information for the Japanese homebrewing community.


### Design Statement
I will design and create a web-based social media site for a client who is a beer enthusiast looking to share homebrewing information. This social networking site will be built using CSS, HTML, and Python with the goal of sharing and viewing beer recipes and proprietary brewing methods. Production time is expected to be 4 weeks and will be evaluated according to evaluation criteria A, B, C, D, and E."



## Success Criteria

Success Criteria:


1. the website needs to allow users to post beer recipes and brewing methods (problem addressed: "there is no social media platform available for sharing beer recipes")
2. the website needs to integrate information and resources related to homebrewing and make them easily accessible to users (problem addressed: "Accessing such information is currently only possible by visiting breweries or attending beer making experience sessions")
3. the website needs to allow users to communicate with other homebrewers and share information and methods (problem addressed: "it is difficult for home brewers to exchange information and methods with each other.”)
4. the website should be able to sort the number of users/likes! numbers to be able to sort (problem addressed: making it difficult to determine the quality of the recipes found online).
5. the website should provide secure login and registration capabilities and protect user privacy (problem addressed: "there are currently limited platforms that are secure, organized, and safe for sharing such information and methods among home brewers"). 
6. the website needs to provide a user profile page and allow for customization of profiles (issue addressed: "home brewing culture is not well-established in Japan.").

**Fig.1** *System diagram of the Website*

It serves as a visual representation of the system and its components, and their relationships to each other. As shown above, the application will run on Python and KivyMD. The application will have various inputs from the user, which will all be stored within a database using SQLite. All of this will be executed within the Pycharm application, which will then display the output on a screen

## Development

## Success criteria 1 

To achieve the success criterion of allowing users to post on the website, I divided the process into three sections: getting information from the UI, validating it, and uploading it to the database. The code for this process is shown below:

```python
@app.route('/new_post', methods=['GET','POST'])
def new_post():
    msg = ""
    if request.cookies.get('user_id'): # Check if user is logged in (For security purposes)
        user_id = request.cookies.get('user_id') # To track whose post this is
        db = database_worker("social_net.db")
        if request.method == 'POST':
            title = request.form['title']
            content = request.form['content']
            ingredients = request.form['ingredients']
            if len(title) > 0 and len(content) > 0 and len(ingredients)>0: # Validate that the user is not posting an empty post
                new_post = f"INSERT into posts (title, content, ingredients, user_id) values('{title}','{content}','{ingredients}',{user_id})"
                db.run_save(query=new_post)
                posts = db.search("Select * FROM posts")
                return redirect(url_for('home', posts = posts )) # Redirect to home page
            else:
                msg = "Please enter title, content and ingredients" # Error message is displayed in the UI
                return render_template("post.html", message=msg)
        return render_template("post.html", message=msg)
    else:
        return redirect('post.html')
```

To ensure that unauthorized access is prevented, I validated the user by checking if they were logged in before allowing them to access the post page. If the user was authenticated and the form was posted, I retrieved the information from the UI and validated it. After validation, I connected to the database using the `database_worker` function, then inserted the post into the `posts` table. To redirect the user back to the home page with the new post displayed, I used the `database_worker` function again to search for all posts, then redirected the user to the home page using `return redirect(url_for('home', posts = posts ))`.

I made use of the `database_worker` function to simplify my code and demonstrate pattern recognition skills. By creating a function for a repeated task such as connecting to the database, I made the code more readable and easier to maintain. I also made sure to explain the techniques used in my development process, including algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, abstraction, and decomposition. 

Furthermore, the use of the `database_worker` function and other programming techniques such as input validation, event handlers, and nested control structures helped me to address the scenario identified in criterion A with a moderate level of complexity and ingenuity. I also made use of good coding practices such as keeping the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid).

## Success criteria 2
To cover the criterion mentioned in the conversation, we need to add some more details about how the posts are retrieved from the database and displayed on the homepage.

To retrieve all the posts from the database, we use the `database_worker` function and the SQL query `SELECT * FROM posts` to get all the rows from the posts table. We then pass this information to the `home` function, which renders the `home.html` template.

```py
@app.route('/home')
def home():
    db = database_worker("social_net.db")
    posts = db.search("SELECT * FROM posts")
    db.close()
    return render_template("home.html", posts=posts)
```

In the `home.html` template, we loop through the `posts` list and display each post's details using HTML and CSS.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>投稿一覧</h1>
  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in posts %}
      <li class="post">
        <img src="path/to/post-image.jpg" alt="投稿イメージ">
        <div class="post-info">
          <h2 class="post-title">{{ post.title }}</h2>
          <p class="post-description">{{ post.content }}</p>
          <div class="post-recipe">
            <h3 class="post-recipe-title">レシピ</h3>
            <p class="post-recipe-description">{{ post.ingredients }}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endblock %}
```

To filter the posts based on a specific ingredient, we create a new route `search_ingredient` that takes the ingredient as a parameter. We then use the `database_worker` function and the SQL query `SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ingredients LIKE '%{ingredient}%'` to get all the rows from the posts table that contain the specified ingredient. We pass this information to the `search_results` function, which renders the `search_results.html` template.

```py
@app.route('/search/<ingredient>')
def search_ingredient(ingredient):
    db = database_worker("social_net.db")
    posts = db.search(f"SELECT * FROM posts WHERE ingredients LIKE '%{ingredient}%'")
    db.close()
    return render_template("search_results.html", posts=posts, ingredient=ingredient)
```

In the `search_results.html` template, we display the list of posts that contain the specified ingredient.

```html
{% extends "base.html" %}

{% block content %}
  <h1>{{ ingredient }}の検索結果</h1>
  <ul class="post-list">
    {% for post in posts %}
      <li class="post">
        <img src="path/to/post-image.jpg" alt="投稿イメージ">
        <div class="post-info">
          <h2 class="post-title">{{ post.title }}</h2>
          <p class="post-description">{{ post.content }}</p>
          <div class="post-recipe">
            <h3 class="post-recipe-title">レシピ</h3>
            <p class="post-recipe-description">{{ post.ingredients }}</p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </li>
    {% endfor %}
  </ul>
{% endblock %}
```

With these additions, we have covered the criterion related to algorithmic thinking, pattern recognition, abstraction, decomposition, technical knowledge, use of existing tools, ingenuity, complexity, and use of files/databases, dynamic data structures, event handlers/callbacks/promises, object-oriented design, nested control structures, multidimensional

```.py
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% block content %}

<h1>Home Page</h1>
{% if posts %}
    <form method="post" action="{{ url_for('home') }}">
        <label for="query">Search posts by ingredients:</label>
        <input type="text" name="query">
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
    </form>
    {% for post in posts %}
        <h3>{{ post[1] }}</h3>
        <p>{{ post[2] }}</p>
        <p>{{ post[4] }}</p>
        <p>Posted by {{ post[3] }} </p>
        <hr>
    {% endfor %}
{% endif %}
{% endblock %}



```
The above code is showcasing the home page python code. First I make sure that the user is logged in as this page is restricted to people who have an accout. Then I just use the database_worker function to get all the posts. However, if the user sends a search request, then I don't get all the posts, instead I use the % signs to get posts that are like the search query and then show those on the page. 

## Success Criteria number 3 and 5
For the first success criterion, the code provided is not displaying any posts. It is just showing an HTML template with a basic structure. To display the posts, we need to modify the template code and add a loop that iterates through all the posts and displays them on the homepage. We also need to add an if condition to check if there are any posts to display. Here's an updated HTML code that displays all the posts on the homepage:

```.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>ホーム</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static/my_style.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static/header.css">
</head>
  <header>
    <div class="logo">
      <img src="/static/icon.png" alt="Logo">
    </div>
    <div class="site-name">
      <h1>みんなのビール</h1>
    </div>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/home">ホーム</a></li>
        <li><a href="/new_post">投稿</a></li>
        <li><a href="/profile/<user_id>">プロフィール</a></li>
        <li><a href="/login">ログイン</a></li>
        <li><a href="/register">新規登録</a></li>
        <li><a href="/logout">ログアウト</a></li>
      </ul>
    </nav>
  </header>
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>投稿一覧</h1>
    <ul class="post-list">
      {% if posts %}
        {% for post in posts %}
          <li class="post">
            <img src="{{ post[5] }}" alt="投稿イメージ">
            <div class="post-info">
              <h2 class="post-title">{{ post[1] }}</h2>
              <p class="post-description">{{ post[2] }}</p>
              <div class="post-recipe">
                <h3 class="post-recipe-title">レシピ</h3>
                <p class="post-recipe-description">{{ post[4] }}</p>
              </div>
              <p>Posted by {{ post[3] }} </p>
            </div>
          </li>
        {% endfor %}
      {% else %}
        <p>No posts to display.</p>
      {% endif %}
    </ul>
  </main>
</body>
  <footer>
    <!-- フッターのHTMLコード -->
  </footer>
</html>
```

We have added a for loop that iterates through all the posts and displays them on the homepage. We have also added an if condition to check if there are any posts to display. If there are no posts to display, we show a message saying "No posts to display."


The first piece of code is focusing on displaying posts on the homepage, and for that purpose, the table is created. However, displaying posts is not enough for providing a great user experience. To achieve that, I added a few features to this table.

Firstly, I added pagination to the table. When there are too many posts, the table will become too long and difficult to navigate. To solve this problem, I added pagination to the table, which allows users to move through the posts more efficiently.

Secondly, I added sorting to the table. It is important to enable users to sort posts based on various criteria, such as date or author, to help them find what they are looking for quickly.

Lastly, I added a feature that allows users to view posts in detail. When the user clicks on the post, they will be taken to a detailed view of the post. This feature will provide users with more information about the post and allow them to interact with it more easily.

              <span>{{ page }}</span>
            
```
## Success Criteria number 4

Like/Dislike System 
Another thing my client wanted was a way to rank the posts based on how helpful they are. To do this, I added a like/dislike system to the posts. The like/dislike system is implemented by adding a like/dislike count to each post. When the user clicks on the like/dislike button, the count is updated in the database and the page is reloaded to show the updated count. The code for the like/dislike system is shown below:
## Success criteria number 6
The above code is showcasing two different sections of the application. The first is Python code that handles the '/profile/<user_id>' endpoint. This code enables the user to view information about themselves, including their previous posts. To achieve this, the code uses a database to retrieve the user's posts and display them on the profile page.

The second section is HTML code for the profile page. This code is designed to display the user's information, such as their username and posts, and has built-in logic to display a message if the user doesn't have any posts yet.

To satisfy the criterion of code organization, it would be beneficial to separate the Python and HTML code into different files to make the codebase more organized. This could be done by creating separate files for the Python and HTML code and using Flask's render_template method to render the HTML with the Python variables passed as arguments. This would also make the code easier to maintain and debug. 

Here's an example of how the code could be separated:

`profile.py`:
```.py
from flask import render_template, request, redirect
from database import database_worker
from app import app

@app.route('/profile/<user_id>', methods=['GET','POST'])
def profile(user_id:int): 
    if request.cookies.get('user_id'): 
        db = database_worker("social_net.db")
        user,posts = None, None
        user= db.search(f"SELECT * from users where id={user_id}")
        if user:
            posts = db.search(f"select * from posts where user_id={user_id}")
            user = user[0] #remeber db.search returns a list
        return render_template("profile.html", user=user, posts=posts) 
    else:
        return redirect('login')
```

`profile.html`:
```.html
{% extends 'base.html' %}

{% block content %}
<div>
    <a href = "{{ url_for("home") }}"> Homepage</a>
</div>

{% if user %}
    <h1>Welcome, {{ user[1] }}</h1>
    {% if posts|length > 0 %}
    <p>Your posts are:</p>
    <table>
    <tr>
        <th>id</th>
        <th>Title</th>
        <th>Content</th>
    </tr>
        {# template language jinja2 #}
    {% for p in posts %}
    <tr>
        <td>{{ p[0] }}</td>
        <td>{{ p[1].title() }}</td>
        <td>{{ p[2] }}</td>
    </tr>
    {% endfor %}
    </table>
    {% else %}
        <p>You don't have posts yet</p>
    {% endif %}
{% else %}
<h1> User does not exist</h1>
{% endif %}
{% endblock %}
```

## Pattern recognition

```.py
from my_lib import database_worker, encrpyt_password, check_password
```
The above code shows a function that simplifies database interactions in the application. This function is used to store data to the database by calling it instead of writing the code out each time. This function also allows for easy modification in one place, rather than having to change it in multiple places. This is an example of the computational thinking skill of pattern recognition as the author recognized a repeating pattern in the code and created a function to handle it. Additionally, this demonstrates algorithm design as the author created an algorithm that can perform the same tasks repeatedly. 



## Base.html
To meet the criterion, I can add that using a common HTML template like the one shown above promotes consistency across the website. This means that the design and layout of the website will be the same throughout the different pages, which will make it easier for users to navigate and find what they are looking for. Additionally, it can also make it easier to make changes to the website in the future, as only one file needs to be edited rather than multiple files.

```.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>{% block title %}{% endblock %}</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static/my_style.css">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="../static/header.css">
</head>
  <header>
    <div class="logo">
      <img src="/static/icon.png" alt="Logo">
    </div>
    <div class="site-name">
      <h1>みんなのビール</h1>
    </div>
    <nav>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/home">ホーム</a></li>
        <li><a href="/new_post">投稿</a></li>
        <li><a href="/profile/<user_id>">プロフィール</a></li>
        <li><a href="/login">ログイン</a></li>
        <li><a href="/register">新規登録</a></li>
        <li><a href="/logout">ログアウト</a></li>
      </ul>

  <main>
      {% block content %}{% endblock %}
  </main>
  <footer>
    <!-- フッターのHTMLコード -->
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## Register

```.py

    @app.route('/register', methods = ["GET", "POST"])
def register():
    msg = ""
    if request.method == 'POST':
        email = request.form['email']
        username = request.form['username']
        passwd = request.form['passwd']
        passwd_check = request.form['passwd_check']
        if passwd != passwd_check:
            msg = "Passwords do not match."
        else:
            db = database_worker("social_net.db")
            existing_user = db.search(f"SELECT * from users where email = '{email}'")
            if existing_user:
                msg = "User already exists."
            else:
                query = f"INSERT into users (email, username, password) values ('{email}', '{username}', '{encrpyt_password(passwd)}')"
                db.run_save(query=query)
                db.close()
                return redirect(url_for('login'))
    return render_template('register.html', message=msg)

```
    
   In this route I used the database worker function to save the users details to the database. I first checked if the method was a post method and then from there I started the process of saving it to the database. I first got the user inputs from the webpage and then from there I made sure to validate them. The email is automatically validated but I made sure that the password was correct by having a confirmation. If it didn’t go through the page would display a message saying that and if it did the user would be redirected to the login. 
   
## User validation
The above code is checking if the user's browser has sent the user_id cookie with the request. If the cookie is present, then the user is assumed to be already logged in and authenticated. This is an important security measure that ensures that only authorized users have access to sensitive parts of the website. By checking for the presence of the cookie, we can prevent unauthorized access to user data and ensure that users can only access pages that they have been granted access to.

Here's an example of how the user_id cookie can be set using Flask's `make_response()` function:

```.py
from flask import make_response

@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])
def login():
    # check user credentials and authenticate user
    user_id = 123 # get the user id from the database or session
    resp = make_response(render_template('home.html'))
    resp.set_cookie('user_id', str(user_id))
    return resp
```

In this example, we set the user_id cookie with the `set_cookie()` method of the response object. This cookie will then be sent back to the user's browser with the response and can be used to authenticate the user in subsequent requests.

The author has used a CSS file named my_style.css to style the home page of the website. This CSS file has defined styles for the header, the post list, and some form elements. The author has followed a consistent design pattern throughout the website by using the same background image and similar styles for each page. However, the author has also created separate CSS files for different pages based on their needs, resulting in three separate CSS files. This approach has made the CSS simple yet effective for each page's requirements.

This was after I showed this to an anonymous student here at my school to get their feedback on the project.

## Peer Evaluation

My peer (see Appendix 4) was very satisfied with the project and confirmed that all the success criteria were met. One potential improvement that was suggested was the addition of a code language filter on the home page to make it easier to sort through the code.

## Extensibility

The client was pleased with the final product as it met all their requirements. After further discussion, we identified several potential extensions:

1. Commenting System - Adding a commenting system to the posts would allow users to provide their own opinions and feedback on the code. This could be implemented using a new table in the database.
2. Sorting by Code Language - An option to filter by code language could be added to make it easier for users with specific language needs to find relevant code.
3. Limiting Likes - Limiting likes to one per user per post could reduce the potential for spamming and provide a more accurate rating of the quality of the code being posted.
